Fortunately, there is a way to fix these errors without downloading any survey, password or malware-infected files. All you need is a few simple steps and some patience. Here is how to do it:
 
1. Make sure you have the latest version of GTA 4 CRACK installed on your PC. If not, update it from the official website or the source where you downloaded it from.
2. Go to the folder where GTA 4 CRACK is installed and right-click on the LaunchGTAIV.exe file. Select Properties and then Compatibility. Check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and choose Windows XP (Service Pack 3) from the drop-down menu. Click Apply and OK.
3. Next, right-click on the LaunchGTAIV.exe file again and select Run as administrator. This will launch the game with elevated privileges and hopefully fix some of the errors.
4. If you still get errors, you may need to update your graphics card drivers and DirectX. You can do this by visiting the official websites of your graphics card manufacturer and Microsoft respectively. Download and install the latest versions of these software and restart your PC.
5. Finally, if none of the above steps work, you may need to tweak some settings in the GTA 4 CRACK configuration file. Go to the folder where GTA 4 CRACK is installed and open the file called commandline.txt with a text editor like Notepad. Add the following lines at the end of the file and save it:

    -norestrictions
    -nomemrestrict
    -availablevidmem 2.0
    -percentvidmem 100
    -novblank
    -noprecache

These commands will disable some of the restrictions and optimizations that GTA 4 CRACK uses by default and may improve your performance and stability. However, they may also cause some graphical glitches or crashes, so use them at your own risk.
 
That's it! You should now be able to play GTA 4 CRACK without any fatal errors. Enjoy!
